## General info

This Git repository contains codes for new developments and comparison of manifold-PCE and DeepONet.

## Methods

* _Manifold PCE_ or _mPCE_ approximates mappings via the identification of low-dimensional embeddings of input and output functions and the construction of a polynomial-based surrogate.

* _DeepONet_ is a deep neural operator model which allows the construction of mapping between infinite dimensional functions via the use of deep neural networks (DNNs).

## Application

The _Brusselator_ diffusion-reaction dynamical system is studied, which describes an autocatalytic chemical reaction between two substances. We explore the capabilities of the studied models and test them for various regression tasks including their extrapolation/generalization ability (perfor-
mance to out-of-distribution data), robustness to noise, ability to handle complex stochastic inputs and highly nonlinear mappings.
